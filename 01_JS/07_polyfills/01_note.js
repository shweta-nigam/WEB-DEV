//      -------------------     polyfills          -------------------------

// A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

// In simple words polyfills are nothing but such functionality which does  not get supported in older versions of browsers.

// The reason why polyfills are not used exclusively is for better functionality and better performance. Native implementations of APIs can do more and are faster than polyfills. 

// -> Other times, polyfills are used to address issues where browsers implement the same features in different ways. (very very rare today!)
